## Summary ##
In this project, I developed an online calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the skills I acquired from previous lessons. The project details are available [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

Upon completion, the calculator should have the following features:

#### Basic Requirements ####
1. Functions for basic math calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Variables to store the first operand, an operator, and the second operand for calculations. 
3. An 'operate' function that takes two operands and an operator as arguments, then calls the appropriate function based on the given operator. 
4. A function that populates the display when a user clicks digit buttons. 
5. Storage of the first operand and operator in designated variables upon clicking operator buttons. 
6. The 'operate' function should be called when the '=' button is clicked, with all required values stored in variables, and the result displayed. 
7. The HTML should include buttons for each digit, operator, equals, clear, and a display.
#### Key Considerations ####
* Users should be able to perform sequential calculations and obtain a final solution. 
* The calculator must display the result of each single set of operands and operator, followed by the next solution. 
* Solutions with long decimals should be rounded to prevent overflow in the display. 
* Address issues caused by clicking the '=' button in unusual flows. 
* The clear button should reset all previous data, allowing for a fresh start. 
* The divide function should display an 'error' message when a user attempts to divide by 0. 
#### Extra Credit ####
- Add a decimal point button. 
- Add a delete button. 
- Enable keyboard support. 
- Enhance the calculator's appearance.
